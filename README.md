- 👋 Hi, I’m Ihsaan

- 👀 I’m interested in Tech, Economics, and Capital Markets.

- My commit history is looking kind of empty... I'm actually actively working on a project in a private repository, I'm not sure why it isn't showing up on my profile! Sometimes I write about my project or other stuff [here](https://imal16.github.io/pages/Unnamed_project1.html)


<!---
Imal16/Imal16 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
